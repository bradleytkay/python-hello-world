# Welcome, new coder.
# Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!'
# to the console (the panel on the right)

print("Hello");
print('Hello, World!');

# Next, PLAY!
# Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

#   1. Change the message that is printed.

print('Goodbye, World!');

#   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?

# Code will not work without parentheses.

#   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?

# Need both opening and closing quotes.  Doesn't matter if ' or '' is used, as long as it's consistent.

#   4. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).

print('4');

#   5. Print multiple messages one after the other.

print('First message')
print('Second message');

#   6. Print two messages on the same line.

print('First message,' 'Second message');

#   7. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".

print('Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"');

#   8. Other. You choose!

print('Thanks!  That was fun.')
